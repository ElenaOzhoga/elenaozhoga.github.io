1. Now dynamic select options, radio button options and required spans are generated in separate function. Is it better to move them to 
renderAttributeWithHtmlTag function?
2. I don't like this loop: 
for (var keyInner in obj[key]) { 
in renderAttributeWithHtmlTag function is used twice. Should I modify renderAttributeWithHtmlTag function to avoid this?
